            <h1 class="post-title">My CISSP Journey: Passing at 100 Questions</h1>
            <p class="post-date">Published on January 2026</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                CISSP is often considered a managerial certification, but my experience proves that a hands-on security engineer can clear it with the right mindset. I passed the CISSP exam at 100 questions with nearly 70 minutes remaining. This blog documents my background, preparation strategy, exam experience, and the lessons I learned along the way.
            </p>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                I work as a security generalist and have experience across cloud security, SIEM implementation, DevSecOps, risk assessment, compliance, and incident response. While I had strong hands-on exposure to many CISSP domains, areas like networking, physical security, and asset security were completely new to me.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have 3.5 years of full-time experience and 1 year of internship experience, totaling approximately 4.5 years. I also hold certifications including CompTIA Security+, AWS Security Specialty, Google Professional Cloud Security Engineer, and Microsoft Azure Security Engineer. With the one-year experience waiver from AWS Security Specialty, I meet the CISSP experience requirement.
            </p>

            <h2>Motivation and When I Started</h2>
            <p>
                I was initially motivated to pursue CISSP by a colleague from my previous company. Later, my current manager, who also holds CISSP, strongly motivated and supported me throughout the journey.
            </p>
            <p>
                While I did not start serious preparation immediately, I was passively consuming CISSP-related content from February 2025, spending around one to two hours per week.
            </p>
            <p>
                The real preparation started in August 2025, when I purchased the official CISSP CBK and official practice tests.
            </p>

            <h2>Study Resources</h2>

            <h3>Official CISSP CBK</h3>
            <p>
                I started with the official CISSP CBK but never completed it. The language felt dense and difficult to follow. I primarily used it as a reference rather than a primary learning source.
            </p>

            <h3>LinkedIn Learning - Mike Chapple</h3>
            <p>
                This was the most impactful resource in my preparation. The course explained concepts clearly and aligned perfectly with the CISSP mindset. I completed the entire course in about two weeks.
            </p>

            <h3>Andrew Ramdayal</h3>
            <p>
                I purchased Andrew Ramdayal's CISSP course but completed only around ten percent of it. However, his CISSP mindset videos were extremely valuable and helped reinforce how to approach exam questions.
            </p>

            <h2>Practice Tests</h2>
            <p>
                Practice tests played the most important role in building my confidence.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Official CISSP practice tests including all domain-wise questions and four full-length exams</li>
                <li>LearnZApp ISC2 Official CISSP App (all free questions)</li>
                <li>Destination CISSP App (all free questions)</li>
                <li>LinkedIn Learning full-length practice exams with consistent scores around eighty percent</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Exam Day Experience</h2>
            <p>
                I appeared for the exam at the Gurugram test center in India. Since there was no CISSP test center available in Rajasthan, I had to travel nearly six hundred kilometers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The exam environment was professional and strict. The questions were scenario-based and required careful reading. Most questions focused on decision-making rather than direct technical knowledge.
            </p>

            <h2>The 100 Question Moment</h2>
            <p>
                When the exam suddenly ended at 100 questions and the survey appeared, I panicked. In the CISSP CAT format, stopping at 100 questions can mean either a very good or very bad outcome.
            </p>
            <p>
                After completing the survey, I collected my belongings and waited for the result. When the Pearson VUE staff handed me the printed result with "Congratulations" on it, it was an unforgettable moment.
            </p>

            <h2>CISSP Mindset and Exam Strategy</h2>
            <p>
                CISSP is all about mindset. Focus on keywords like BEST, FIRST, and PRIMARY. Always prioritize process over technology and follow the order Prevent, Detect, Correct.
            </p>

            <p>Example question logic:</p>
            <div class="code-block">
Policy implemented in email security solution  
User training  
EDR  
Device encryption
            </div>
            <p>
                In real life, you would apply multiple controls. In the CISSP exam, you must choose the single best preventive control. In this example, user training is the best answer.
            </p>

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
                I am a hands-on security engineer and not a traditional manager. However, CISSP does not require you to be a manager. It requires you to understand how systems and companies actually work.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you understand how systems and a company operate end to end, you can think like a manager.
            </p>

            <p>
                Best of luck to everyone preparing for CISSP. Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn if you have any questions.
