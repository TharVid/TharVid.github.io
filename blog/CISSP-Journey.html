            <h1 class="post-title">My CISSP Journey: Passing at 100 Questions</h1>
            <p class="post-date">Published on January 2026</p>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                I work as a security generalist and work across cloud security, SIEM implementation, DevSecOps, risk assessment, compliance, and incident response. I already had hands-on experience in multiple CISSP domains, but topics like networking, physical security, and asset security were completely new for me.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have 3.5 years of full-time experience and 1 year of internship experience, making it around 4.5 years in total. I also hold certifications such as CompTIA Security+, AWS Security Specialty, Google Professional Cloud Security Engineer, and Azure Security Engineer. With the one-year experience waiver from AWS Security Specialty, I meet the CISSP experience requirement.
            </p>

            <h2>Motivation and Starting Point</h2>
            <p>
                I was initially motivated to pursue CISSP by a colleague from my previous company. Later, my current manager, who also holds CISSP, motivated and supported me a lot throughout my journey.
            </p>
            <p>
                While I did not start serious preparation immediately, I was passively consuming CISSP-related content from February 2025, spending around one to two hours per week.
            </p>
            <p>
                The real preparation started in August 2025, when I purchased the official CISSP CBK and official practice tests.
            </p>

            <h2>Study Resources</h2>

            <h3>Official CISSP CBK</h3>
            <p>
                I started studying from the official CISSP CBK but never completed it. I found the language difficult to understand, so I mostly used it as a reference and focused more on practice questions.
            </p>

            <h3>LinkedIn Learning - Mike Chapple</h3>
            <p>
                This course was the best resource for me. It explains concepts in a very simple and clear way and helps build the CISSP mindset. I completed the entire course in around two weeks.
            </p>

            <h3>Andrew Ramdayal</h3>
            <p>
                I purchased Andrew Ramdayal's CISSP course but completed only a small portion of it. I mainly watched the mindset videos and solved practice questions. By that time, I already felt prepared, but his mindset guidance was very useful.
            </p>

            <h2>Practice Tests</h2>
            <p>
                Practice tests played the most important role in my preparation.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Official CISSP practice tests including all domain-wise questions and four full-length tests</li>
                <li>LearnZApp ISC2 Official CISSP App free questions</li>
                <li>Destination CISSP App free questions</li>
                <li>LinkedIn Learning full-length practice exams with scores around eighty percent</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Exam Day Experience</h2>
            <p>
                I appeared for the exam at the Gurugram test center. Since there was no CISSP test center in Rajasthan, I had to travel almost six hundred kilometers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The questions were scenario-based and similar to what I saw in the official CBK and LinkedIn Learning practice tests. I read each question carefully to identify keywords before selecting the answer.
            </p>

            <h2>The 100 Question Moment</h2>
            <p>
                When the exam suddenly ended at 100 questions and the survey appeared, I panicked. In the CISSP CAT format, the exam stops at 100 questions only if you perform very well or very poorly.
            </p>
            <p>
                After completing the survey, I collected my belongings and waited for the result. When the printed result was handed to me and it said congratulations, it was an unforgettable moment.
            </p>

            <h2>CISSP Mindset and Strategy</h2>
            <p>
                Focus on keywords like BEST, FIRST, and PRIMARY. Always prioritize process over technology and follow the order prevent, detect, correct.
            </p>

            <div class="code-block">

            </div>

            <p>
                In real life, you would apply multiple controls. In the CISSP exam, you must choose the single best preventive control. In this case, user training is the correct answer.
            </p>

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
                I am a hands-on security engineer and not a traditional manager. CISSP does not require you to be a manager.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you understand how systems and company actually work, you can think like a manager.
            </p>

            <p>
                Best of luck to everyone preparing for CISSP. Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn if you have any questions.
